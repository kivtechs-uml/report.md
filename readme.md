## SWITCH of base

	Initially the chatbot was supposed to be based on IBM WATSON. but as Ivory,Olive & project C worked well and its feature could be used in many fileds 
	As OPEN AI & CHATGPT was viral and almost everybody understood AI/ML all of a sudden.
	I have been working in  AI/ML & DATA ANALYTIX from 2018 so no one understood what I was working in,but all of a sudden telling them I am working in AI/ML was understood by everybody 
	 
	so the base was switched from IBM WATSON to OPEN AI - chatgpt
